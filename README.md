# Phase 1 Week 1 Code Challenge - JavaScript Toy Problems

In this code cahllenge you will find three challenges that test your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

# Prerequisites: 

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 
-Structured with one folder per challenge (`Challenge1`, `Challenge2`, `Challenge3`) and 3-4 solution files per challenge, with each file containing a single solution.

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.
-All solutions are written using javascript.

3. Push the solution to the Github repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.


## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator 

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 50 to 59
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40


# Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
 

# Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
